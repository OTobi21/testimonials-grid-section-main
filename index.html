                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
                switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                startup. ”

              can help me learn programming <br />step by step. I was encouraged

              enroll by a former student of theirs <br />who can only say
              wonderful things <br />about the program. The entire <br />

              particular, was outstanding. It took <br />my learning to the next
              level in a way <br />that no tutorial could ever have. In
              <br />fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br />interviews as
              an example of my <br />developent experience. It certainly
              <br />helped me land a job as a full-stack <br />developer after
              receiving multiple <br />offers. 100% recommend! ”
